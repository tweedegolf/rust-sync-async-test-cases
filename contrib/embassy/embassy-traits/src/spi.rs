/// # Notes
///
/// - It's the task of the user of this interface to manage the slave select lines
///
/// - Due to how full duplex SPI works each `read` call must be preceded by a `write` call.
///
/// - `read` calls only return the data received with the last `write` call.
/// Previously received data is discarded
///
/// - Data is only guaranteed to be clocked out when the `read` call succeeds.
/// The slave select line shouldn't be released before that.
///
/// - Some SPIs can work with 8-bit *and* 16-bit words. You can overload this trait with different
/// `Word` types to allow operation in both modes.
